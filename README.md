These are the codes in both R and Mathematica accompanying the manuscript "Understanding the impact of third-party
species on pairwise coexistence" by Deng, Taylor and Saavedra. The codes in R and Mathematica are independent, and their results match perfectly. Both codes are well commented with simple examples. So you can choose whichever you prefer.

Specifically, the codes in R provides the functions (toolbox.R) and an example (example.R) for the analytical computations of *projection contribution* and *system-level long-term effects* as described in the manuscript. The codes in Mathematica contain the functions and an example for *system-level long-term effects* using Monte Carlo method.
